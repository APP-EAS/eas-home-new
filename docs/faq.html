              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Unlike general development agencies, we focus exclusively on AI and automation solutions. This specialized focus allows us to develop deeper expertise in these technologies and deliver more effective solutions. We also take a business-first approach, focusing on understanding your specific challenges and desired outcomes rather than pushing specific technologies.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, we offer various support options ranging from basic maintenance to comprehensive managed services.

              <h3>What AI technologies do you work with?</h3>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We work with a wide range of AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, generative AI, predictive analytics, and recommendation systems. We select the most appropriate technologies based on your specific needs rather than trying to fit your problem to a particular technology.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, we specialize in integrating AI and automation solutions with existing systems. Whether you're using legacy software, modern SaaS platforms, or custom-built solutions, we can create seamless integrations that enable data flow and process automation.

              <h3>Do we need to have a lot of data to implement AI solutions?</h3>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The data requirements depend on the specific solution you need. Some AI applications require substantial historical data, while others can work effectively with limited data or can leverage pre-trained models and external data sources. During our discovery phase, we'll assess your data availability and quality, and recommend solutions that are feasible with your current data assets or help you develop a data collection strategy if needed.</p>

                <p>We specialize in developing custom AI solutions tailored to your specific business needs. While we may leverage existing frameworks, libraries, and APIs where appropriate, our solutions are designed and built specifically for your unique challenges rather than simply implementing off-the-shelf products.</p>

                <p>Project timelines vary significantly depending on the scope, complexity, and specific requirements. Simple automation workflows might take 4-6 weeks, while comprehensive AI solutions with multiple integrations could take 3-6 months or longer.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Successful projects require collaboration between our team and yours. During the discovery phase, we'll need significant input from stakeholders who understand your business processes and goals. Throughout development, we'll need regular feedback on progress and functionality. We'll also work with your IT team on integrations and deployments. We'll clearly outline the expected time commitments and responsibilities at the start of the project.</p>

                <p>Yes, comprehensive training is an integral part of our process. We provide training tailored to different user groups, from end-users to administrators and technical staff. Our training includes hands-on sessions, documentation, and access to resources for ongoing learning. Our goal is to ensure your team can effectively use and manage the solution after deployment.</p>

              <h3>How do you price your services?</h3>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our pricing varies depending on the scope, complexity, and specific requirements of each project. We typically use one of the following models:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Fixed-price projects:</strong> For well-defined projects with clear requirements, we can provide a fixed price based on the agreed scope.</li>
                  <li><strong>Time and materials:</strong> For projects with evolving requirements or where flexibility is important, we can work on a time and materials basis.</li>
                  <li><strong>Phased approach:</strong> For larger projects, we often recommend a phased approach with defined milestones and costs for each phase.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After our initial discovery conversation, we'll recommend the most appropriate pricing model and provide a detailed estimate for your project.</p>

              <h3>Do you offer any guarantees on your work?</h3>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We stand behind the quality of our work and offer warranties on our solutions, typically covering a period of 30-90 days after deployment. During this period, we'll address any issues or bugs at no additional cost. For ongoing support beyond the warranty period, we offer various support packages to ensure your solution continues to perform optimally.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our payment structure typically includes an initial deposit (usually 25-33% of the project total), followed by milestone payments throughout the project. For larger projects, we often structure payments to align with specific deliverables or phases. We'll clearly outline the payment schedule in our proposal and agreements.</p>
